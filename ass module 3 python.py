# What is List? How will you reverse a list?
# Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.A built-in function called reverse() is used to reverse the list. 


# How will you remove last object from a list? Suppose list1 is [2, 33, 222, 14, and 25], what is list1 [-1]?
# By using pop
# list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
# list1.pop(-1)
# print(list1)  


# Differentiate between append () and extend () methods? 
# append() method adds a single element to the end of the list, while extend() method adds multiple elements to the end of the list.
# append() method modifies the original list by adding the new element as a single item, while extend() method modifies the original list by adding each element of the iterable as individual items to the end of the list.
# l1= [1, 2, 3]
# l2 = [4, 5, 6]
# l1.append(l2)
# print(l1)  
# l1.extend(l2)
# print(l1)

#  What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple.
# A tuple is a collection of ordered, immutable elements enclosed in parentheses () and separated by commas. Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable, which means that once a tuple is created, you cannot modify its elements.
# Lists are mutable, which means you can add, remove, or modify elements after the list has been created. Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable, which means that once a tuple is created, you cannot modify its elements
# Lists are defined using square brackets [], while tuples are defined using parentheses ().
# Example of a list
# my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Example of a tuple
# my_tuple = (1, 'two', 3.0, [4, 5])


#  Write a Python program to create a tuple with different data types.
# tuple = ('hello', 42, True, [1, 2, 3], {'a': 1, 'b': 2})
# print(tuple)


#  Write a Python program to create a tuple with numbers
# tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
# print(tuple)


#  Write a Python program to convert a tuple to a string.
# tuple = ('h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o')

# print(string)


# Write a Python program to check whether an element exists within a tuple. 
# tuple = ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange')
# if 'banana' in tuple:
#     print('banana exists in the tuple')
# else:
#     print('banana does not exist in the tuple')


#  Write a Python program to find the length of a tuple.

#  Write a Python program to convert a list to a tuple.

# my_list = [(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9)]
# new_list = []
# for tuple in my_list:
#     new_list.append(tuple[:-1] + (10,))

#  How will you create a dictionary using tuples in python? 
# To create a dictionary using tuples in Python, you can pass a list of tuples to the dict() constructor function. Each tuple in the list should contain exactly two elements, where the first element is the key and the second element is the value.
# list = [("apple", 5), ("banana", 2), ("orange", 7)]
# dict = dict(list)
# print("Original list:", list)
# print("Dictionary:",dict)
